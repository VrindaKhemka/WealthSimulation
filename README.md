# Wealth Distribution Analysis using Economic Models

## Overview

This project simulates three distinct economic models to analyze wealth distribution, using Agent Based Simulation Modelling. The goal is to understand the impact of these factors on wealth inequality and to develop a modified tax model aimed at achieving a more equitable distribution of wealth in India.


## Key Objectives

- **Simulation of Economic Models:** Developed three different models with varying assumptions:
  - **Model 1:** Very basic model with equal intial wealth. Economy grows in the form of randomly distributed wealth packets.
  - **Model 2:** Intermediate model introducing taxation and economic classes (Rich, Middle Poor). Collected tax is redistributed equally.
  - **Model 3:** Realistic model where redistribution is proportional to current wealth. Introduced variables dictating probability of agent interaction between different economic classes.

- **Validation of Models:** Assessed the accuracy and effectiveness of each model using three key equality metrics:
  - **Gini Index:** Measures income or wealth inequality within a population.
  - **Coefficient of Variation (CV):** Provides a standardized measure of dispersion in wealth distribution.
  - **Palma Ratio:** Compares the share of income of the richest 10% to that of the poorest 40%.

- **Developing a Modified Tax Model:** Currently focused on creating a new tax model tailored to promote a more equitable distribution of wealth in India.


## Future Work

- Refining the modified tax model to improve wealth distribution in India.
- Expanding the model to include additional variables such as inflation, employment rates, and government spending.
- Working on the possibility of publication.
